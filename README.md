# Vehicle Registration Plate Object Detection

### Project Summary:
This project creates a machine learning model to operate an object detection task on vehicle registration plates, using PyTorch.

---

### Dataset Description:

This dataset consists of `5308` training and `386` validation dataset. Each dataset has images in `.jpg` format and labels in `.txt` format with the `xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax` format. Below are sample images from some of the classes present in the dataset:

### Machine Learning Model Architecture:

I used pretrained model `yolov9c.pt` with the pretrained weight and and trained it to be able to detect the vehicle registration plates.

### Training Hyperparameters:

* Epochs: `30`
  
* In put Image size: `640`
